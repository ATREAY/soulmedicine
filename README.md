# Soul Medicine

[![CI](https://github.com/chaynHQ/soulmedicine/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chaynHQ/soulmedicine/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Through notes of love and information, Soul Medicine offers bite-sized support to survivors, and an easy system to find meaningful support. This service has resources on opening a bank account, managing money, regaining confidence after trauma, coping with stress, and practicing assertive communication. It also contains the written [Bloom](https://bloom.chayn.co/) courses. Soul Medicine gives users the option to follow their own pathway and receive disguised safeguarded emails at a specific time.
